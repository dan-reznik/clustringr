Title: Cluster Strings by Edit-Distance
Version: 1.0
Author: Dan S. Reznik
Maintainer: Dan S. Reznik <dreznik@gmail.com>
Description: Returns an edit-distance based clusterization of an input vector of strings.
    Each cluster will contain a set of strings w/ small mutual edit-distance
    (e.g., levenshtein, optimum-sequence-alignment, damerau-lev), as computed by
    stringdist::stringdist(). The set of all mutual edit-distances is then used by g
    graph algorithms (from package igraph) to single out subsets of high connectivity.
